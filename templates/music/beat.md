# The Beat Made Me Do It

![](music/tlaloc.jpg)

in sleep and waking dreams, they revealed to me The Beat: that perfect rhythm primordial and unholy, which once heard will eternally possess the listener with its madness. In its repetitious drums I heard the rhythm of coitus and the building of pyramids, vast monuments and human sacrifices to The Beat, the ultimate tool of civilizational destruction. It was the song of Tenochtitlan and Los Angeles. I recognized it instantly, and resisted with every fiber of my being. They taunted me, saying: you will never recreate this beat.

You would give up everything you ever wanted to hear The Beat again.
