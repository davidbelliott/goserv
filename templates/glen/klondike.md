# Klondike Bar (Driftwood Canyon)

![A sheep trail carved into the rock by the Navajo Indians.  Just above Klondike Bar, looking upstream past Driftwood Canyon.  Holes drilled in the rock held sticks which made fence posts for a shubbery that was laid down so the sheep couldn't see the drop beneath them.](klondike/sheep-trail.jpg)
