# Gregory Natural Bridge (Soda Gulch)

Something else would eliminate this magnificent structure.

In the early 1960's road maps began to show Gregory Bridge up on the plateau above, well away from the waters of future Lake Powell where earlier maps properly showed it.  However, the top pool level of Lake Powell, 3710' is well above the top of Gregory Bridge.
