![Wetsuits in the winter.  But the high walls in a narrow canyon kept the water unfrozen even when everything was frozen outside the canyon.  (On one trip the Colorado River froze from bank to bank forcing some of our party--the ones a day or two behind us--to drag their boats across the ice in places.](cathedral-cyn/wetsuits.jpg)
