(There was a thirteenth in the party but he had to leave us back at the end of our trip down the Narrows of Zion to take his bar exams in Colorado. He passed the exams, soon got elected to the state legislature, and later became governor.)

Two of our twelve are missing, having gotten lost coming out of the Escalante the day before. One of Page Aviation's planes was patrolling the area with a pilot and a park ranger. I accompanied them on a search flight. (The aerial photos taken in 1961 were taken on that flight.) Here we have just landed after our search. More about what happened [HERE](http://home.pacifier.com/~ppenn/gco.html).

The following year we started chartering that same plane -- and often had the same pilot.

We had spent the entire day exploring---down to Clear Creek and up to Soda Gulch and Gregory Bridge. The walk back was very hot, so we waited until just before sunset. Two of our party veered off to the west, toward Davis Gulch: you can see them walking toward the left edge of the picture. We had discussed the route back as being toward the high point in our southward path, the little mesa with the airstrip, and being restricted by two nearby parallel slot canyons, Davis Gulch and Clear Creek which are impossible to cross. And a bit hazardous, especially after dark. Since there are no habitations within about 60 miles, our lights at the car would be a beacon for anyone who got confused. The area is quite flat and the airstrip mesa is the predominant landmark. The two had the only map in our party because I had left it at the gauging station and one of them picked it up for me. That day ended curiously.

Because most of the most spectacular canyons of Glen were between Hole in the Rock and Crossing of the Fathers, we sometimes chose to put in at Hole in the Rock.
