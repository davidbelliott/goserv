# Forbidding Canyon (Aztec Creek) (mile 68.6) (The river route to Rainbow Bridge)

![Mile 68.6  Kolb's sign pointing up Aztec Creek toward Rainbow Bridge.  Probably the most visited canyon of Glen Canyon before the reservoir.  Boat trips were made up the river to visit Rainbow Bridge](forbidding/sign.jpg)

![Then it's about five miles walking to the bridge from the river.  (The Navajo Nation also conducted horseback trips from near the base of Navajo Mtn -- a two day trip,)](forbidding/walking.jpg)
