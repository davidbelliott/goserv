# Dove Canyon (mile 51.5)

![**Mile 51.8. Dec. 1962** Approaching Dove Canyon (left bank).](dove-cyn/approaching.jpg)

![**Dec. 1962** The landing at Dove Canyon is about a mile upstream of West Canyon Creek. That's Gregory Butte looming over West Canyon Creek.](dove-cyn/landing.jpg)

![The exploration of Dove Canyon starts with a long swim.](dove-cyn/swim.jpg)

![**Dec. 1962** This is one of the finest of the long narrow canyons. As we walk up further and further, the light intensity gets less and less. The camera must be on a tripod for most of the pictures and a rather long exposure -- perhaps as much as three minutes -- is needed. This results in blue pictures, and we came to know these canyons as "the blue canyons."](dove-cyn/finest.jpg)

![The predominance of blue is the result of "reciprocity failure" in the emulsions of the film (Kodachrome): as the light gets very dim the responses of the three emulsions in the film no longer follow a simple linear relationship of image density to exposure time. The red and green sensitive layers are most affected by reciprocity failure -- twice the exposure time does not result in half the density of the transparency. The film is relatively "blind" to the red and green ranges of the spectrum. The blue-sensitive layer retains much of the reciprocity relationship, so its response is still pretty good. The blue image remains while the red and green images are largely gone.](dove-cyn/blue-cyn.jpg)
