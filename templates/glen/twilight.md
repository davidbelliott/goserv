![Great depth and parallel walls was this canyon's signature.](twilight/depth.jpg)

![We walked very far up this canyon -- it looked like we could get to the plateau above, but we never had the time to walk that far. Also, the only rattlesnake we saw in Glen was in the boulders of this canyon: a very young rattlesnake which had apparently been washed down from above.](twilight/far-up.jpg)
