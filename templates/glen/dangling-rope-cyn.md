![It's so dark in here, we have the camera on a tripod for a time exposure, and we had to return to our boats for a flashlight before exploring further.](dangling-rope-cyn/dark.jpg)

![**Mile 60.9** That's Cornerstone Canyon in the right bank wall. Just to the left of Cornerstone is The Hermitage.](dangling-rope-cyn/cornerstone-cyn.jpg)

![**Mile 61.5** Cactus covered many of the sandy bars. These plants penetrated tennis shoes rather easily and were camouflaged in the other plants on the bar.](dangling-rope-cyn/cactus.jpg)

A major archeological salvage site was located at the base of the cliff here.
