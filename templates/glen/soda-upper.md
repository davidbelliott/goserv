# Soda Gulch above Gregory Natural Bridge

![The hike up Soda Gulch to the desert above (and to the Hole in the Rock road) is cool and shaded---for the first several miles. A very pleasant walk on the hottest of days.](soda-upper/shaded.jpg)

![A very few of the pools are deep enough to require swimming. (This one didn't.)](soda-upper/pools.jpg)

!["The walls are always gracefully curved and finely patterned..."](soda-upper/curved.jpg)

!["Small alcoves often contain low waterfalls, but nowhere is our progress stopped," There are no chockstones or jumpups that require climbing.](soda-upper/alcoves.jpg)

![Soda Gulch drains enough territory that it almost always has an active stream after it has dropped into it's rock-bottomed canyon.](soda-upper/stream.jpg)

![Soda Gulch is a deep canyon, even for Glen. That helps make the walk up it shady and cool. And very spectacular!](soda-upper/deep.jpg)
