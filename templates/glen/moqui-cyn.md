The name "Moqui" is a misspelling of "Moqûi." The dieresis was put there in the original reports to Spain because the Native Americans pronounced the syllable "kwi" There is no "kwi" sound in Spanish so the dieresis is needed.. A careless typesetter left it off: Moqui. 

The name soon got shortened to "Moki" and that is the spelling and pronounciation most seen and heard today. Unfortunately, in the native language, "moki" means dead or dung.

Unfamiliar cultures often suffer from careless oversimplifiation. (The neighboring Navajo call themselves "Dineh.")
