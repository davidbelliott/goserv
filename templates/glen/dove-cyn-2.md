# Dove Canyon - 2 (mile 51.5)

![Ansel Adams felt that these blue pictures were "too chemical" in appearance and strongly suggested that I find a cure for the problem. The originals are truly monochromatic -- high saturation blue to white. To compensate a little, I've used Photoshop to add a little bit of "second dimension" to the color: mostly red. This makes the image closer to the actual appearance. When we hiked these "blue" canyons we often needed a flashlight to see. And what little illumination we had was usually from an intensely blue sky overhead.](dove-cyn-2/blue.jpg)

![The jumpup in Dove Canyon that stopped most parties had a hole in the ceiling directly overhead. On our last visit there, we did a three-man stand to get Keturah up through the hole. (She then lowered her nylon rope with the loops and the rest of us got up.) We didn't push it much further: too difficult. (And no pictures.)](dove-cyn-2/jumpup.jpg)
