# Dungeon Canyon (mile 56.2)

![Most of this canyon is wider at the bottom than at the top.  In June, when the water is high, many parties use rafts to ferry passengers past this long swim near the mouth.](dungeon-cyn/water.jpg)

![We occasionally met other parties.  Here's one which used yellow rafts to get across the swim.  They asked me to take a picture of them with their camera, so I asked them to reciprocate.  Here's the picture they took with my camera while I stood with their group. Can anyone tell us who they were?](dungeon-cyn/group.jpg)

Dungeon Canyon is one of the most popular and one of the most photographed in Glen.
