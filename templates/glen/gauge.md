![Sept, 1962 The gauging station route seen from a bank above the Escalante River. It's that ledge near the left edge of the photo, and we are looking directly up the route. See the photo below.](gauge/route.jpg)

![On the route from the Hole in the Rock road to the gauging station. This is one of the few places a walker can get down the cliffs into the Escalante Canyon. There was a skeleton of a horse just below those walkers higher up. From the bottom of this rock ledge trail it's a short walk down the sand and slickrock to the Escalante River and the gauging station.
