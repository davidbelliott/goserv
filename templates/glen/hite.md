# Hite (mile 162.3)

![(1962) White Canyon, a little upstream from Hite. The little sand bar where the stream enters the Colorado was our campsite while we waited for the shuttle to return, and it's the put-in point for float trips from Hite.](hite/white-cyn.jpg)

![Landing at the White Canyon airstrip. The car shuttle involves driving all the cars from Hite to Crossing of the Fathers, that's about 300 miles over mostly gravel or dirt roads in earlier days, then using one car to drive all the drivers to the Page Airport where we charter a plane to take us back to Hite where our boats and gear are waiting for us.](hite/airstrip.jpg)
