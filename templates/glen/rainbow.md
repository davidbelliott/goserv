Some suggest that the Capitol Building in Washington D. C. would fit under this bridge.  (Really?)   It is the largest natural bridge in the U. S. --- and Gregory Natural Bridge was the second largest.  (A Natural Bridge is defined as having an active creek flowing under it --- no creek and it's an arch.)
