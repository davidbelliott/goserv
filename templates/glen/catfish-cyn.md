# Catfish Canyon (Wetherill Canyon) (mile 58.7)

![At the mouth of Catfish Canyon, the sun dried mud separated into pads with deep cracks between them. The tree toads, Bufo punctatus, chimneyed in and out of the cracks like human rock climbers, legs pushing on opposite sides. At evening and morning the toads kept up a continuous, loud chorus.](catfish-cyn/toad.jpg)
