![Davis Gulch is the first saw-cut canyon downstream from Soda Gulch (right bank) on the Escalante River. It can easily be entered from the Hole In the Rock road by walking the desert to the west of Davis and dropping down an old Mormon Cattle trail to a corral in the bottom of the gulch.](davis/canyon.jpg)
