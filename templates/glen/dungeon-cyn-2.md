![In September, that swim at the entrance has a lot less water and a lot more mud.](dungeon-cyn-2/mud.jpg)

![Above the swim, Dungeon is easy walking up to a jumpup.  (The cover picture of Eliot Porter's "The Place No One Knew" was taken near the jumpup.)](dungeon-cyn-2/walking.jpg)

![Dungeon provided excellent camera shots and was a favorite of photographers.](dungeon-cyn-2/photogenic.jpg)
