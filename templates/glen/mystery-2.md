![**June 1964** During a flight over Mystery Canyon's upper sections, we spotted a small natural bridge in the upper reaches of Mystery. So we circled back and photographed it.](mystery-2/bridge.jpg)

![Enlarged section of above photograph. And that may be a second bridge a bit further upstream. See Lehi Bridges at Crystal Canyons (John Hart)](mystery-2/bridge-detail.jpg)
