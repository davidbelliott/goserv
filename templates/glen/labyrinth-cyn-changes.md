![**Jan. 1963** A short distance in, a narrow canyon leads to the left.  That is the main branch of Labyrinth Canyon.](labyrinth-cyn/main-branch.jpg)

![**Apr. 1963** Four months later -- the water is rising fast!  The canyons being filled at first are the spectacular narrow ones.](labyrinth-cyn-changes/april-1963.jpg)

![**Jan. 1963** About a half mile in from the mouth.  Photographed from a high alcove we used for camping.  The striped alcove is a trade mark for Labyrinth canyon.](labyrinth-cyn/striped-alcove.jpg)
