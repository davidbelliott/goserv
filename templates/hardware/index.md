# Hardware

Software "engineers" who make electron apps and only know JS and Python won't survive the Kali Yuga. u must understand the system in its entirety, from the p-n junction to the SVM. how do u call urself "wired" but don't know how the data link layer works?

Engineering hardware is more difficult than writing software: electrons obey the laws of God, not of man. One who is given the tools of computing without true understanding will take them for granted and misuse them; such a top-down approach gives rise to the loathsome enterprise Java application. Only by working from the ground up---wave mechanics, Maxwell's equations, linear circuits, thermodynamics, semiconductor devices, analog design, digital design, FPGAs, computer architecture, machine code, assembly, higher-level languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, information theory, operating systems, cryptography, networking, machine learning---can one hope to understand our machines, and understand what is wrong with them today.
