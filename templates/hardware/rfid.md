# RFIDCAP Pocket RFID Reader & Emulator

![](rfid/render.png)

Capture the contents of RFID cards with the click of a button and simultaneously store up to 16 in non-volatile memory. Select the active slot with a rotary encoder and LCD display that shows the current slot index and card contents in hex. Emulate the selected card to any RFID reader, gaining access to all doors opened by any card in memory. The ideal companion of the vadder or roof and tunnel hacker.

Design files will be made available soon. Schematic capture and layout are done in the free and open-source [KiCad EDA](https://www.kicad.org/).
