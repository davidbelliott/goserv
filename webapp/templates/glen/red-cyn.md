# Red Canyon--Ticaboo Rapids #1 (mile 149.9)

![(Mile 149.9) Ticaboo Rapids #1.](red-cyn/ticaboo-rapids.jpg)

This is about as big as the water gets in Glen. And it's very hard to find anything else close to this in the way of "rapids." Many canyons have fine rapids for every level of whitewater running skills: upstream in Cataract Canyon and downstream in Grand Canyon, for Colorado River examples. Glen Canyon is very close to being pure flat water boating.

But the Bureau of Reclamation wanted to put a different spin on reality and on the new reservoir. They wanted flat-water boaters to believe that Lake Powell was opening up Glen Canyon to them,

"[Boat wakes](http://home.pacifier.com/~ppenn/proveglen.html) have replaced the raging rapids of the Colorado," 

"[The wild, red, outlaw river](http://home.pacifier.com/~ppenn/cd.html), tamed. Now flowing clean and blue, unmaimed."

Truth lies in the opposite direction: Boating on Lake Powell can be very difficult and very dangerous for boats not built for rapids because of winds that stir up complex and confusing white-capped waves. Most of Glen Canyon was nestled in deep vertical-walled canyons, sheltered from those winds. 

Lake Powell's winds also evaporate far more of the water stored in the reservoir than the engineers had anticipated before the waters rose. Arguments that this reservoir increases the water available to a thirsty desert community are false most of the time.

We were not totally without mishaps. Keturah was relaxing and admiring the scenery in smooth, fast water, feet up on the deck, while she ran into very shallow water near the shore. Her boat overturned. A big smooth rock near the left shore down by Mystery Canyon created an impressive wave at the highest water. Two of our boats got caught in it and capsized. Each of the boaters was seen standing on the shore and swimming out for flotsam from their boat. Then, one night while camped on a sandy island, we experienced a very high wind--little yellow rafts became kites and wind-blown missles. But by then, we had learned than anything floating on the river quickly finds an eddy and stays circling in place for quite a while. The boats were easily recovered. 

The greatest hazard in Glen Canyon is probably from flash floods while exploring side canyons, and that is something everyone in our parties kept in mind and kept a sharp watch for. Of course, there is that little scorpion, Centuroides sculpturatus, thought to live only in the bottom of Grand Canyon and on the Sonoran Desert, but in fact, had found a home in Glen Canyon--it is one of the two poisonous scorpions in the U.S.

Glen Canyon is a very gentle, very friendly place.

![(Mile 150.4) This is not raging rapids! This is Glen Canyon, not Grand Canyon.  But it is, as we float down further and further, more and more a beautiful canyon---a beautiful experience. Nothing like what lies ahead can be found elsewhere.](red-cyn/not-rapids.jpg)
