June, 1963, the first summer of the reservoir.  We encountered this boat.  It turned out to be Royce Knight, the owner of Page Aviation and an old friend from whom we had been chartering airplanes.  He had some advice for us.  "You should take a look at some of those side canyons up there," he said.  He told us we would be surprised at how extraordinarily spectacular they were.  He had had no idea that those side canyons were the primary reason we had been taking all those trips.  He had not known about them.  He had just discovered what little was left of them and was astonished by what he found.

He will never realize what he had missed.
