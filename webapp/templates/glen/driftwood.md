# Driftwood Canyon (mile 66.5) and Klondike Bar (mile 66.0-66.3)

![Driftwood Canyon was named for the huge deposit of driftwood that the river currents packed into the mouth of this canyon. What you see here is floating on a few feet of water -- an interesting challenge for the explorer in a kayak or raft.

![The deepest stream alcove in Glen Canyon. We needed about a half hour of dune climbing to get through it. When we boated in after the flooding started, we realized that the overhang was about one quarter mile.](driftwood/alcove.jpg)
