# Annie Canyon (mile 106.7)

![**Mile 107.9** Across from Annie Canyon, and a mile upstream, is a collection of mining equipment. (We believe this is probably Shock Bar at the bottom of Shock Trail, but one of our sources of information places these features on the right bank.)](annie-cyn/mining-equipment.jpg)
