![Little Dungeon doesn't have overhanging walls as Dungeon has. (We had difficulty identifying the canyons here along the left bank of the "four-mile fetch" -- mile 51 - 55 -- with Katie Lee's list. This is the next to last canyon before West Canyon Creek. It may be the one Katie Lee called "Dove." We called the last one "Dove." Katie might have called that one, "Happy Canyon.)](little-dungeon-cyn/no-overhangs.jpg)
