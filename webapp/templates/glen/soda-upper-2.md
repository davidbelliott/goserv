![Soda Gulch has many of the giant stream alcoves of Glen Canyon](soda-upper-2/alcoves.jpg)

![One side overhangs the other side.](soda-upper-2/overhang.jpg)

![Stream action cuts deeply into the wall as the water swings around a sharp curve.](soda-upper-2/curve.jpg)

![From the back of the alcove we look up into a great crescent of sky and wall.](soda-upper-2/crescent.jpg)

![Waterseeps are generally located there. Maiden hair fern and Monkey Flower (Mimulus) commonly grow there, and calls of the canyon wren and mourning dove are frequently heard echoing off the wall.](soda-upper-2/seeps.jpg)
