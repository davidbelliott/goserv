# Ice Jam (mile 33)

![**Jan. 1963. Mile 32.8** The heavy flow of ice cannot get past the dam.  About a mile below Labyrinth Canyon it is no longer moving downstream.  Occasionally a small movement occurs with a large grinding noise, but the river is no longer flowing.  Time and the river flowing have been stopped by technology.[^1]](ice-jam/ice-jam.jpg)
