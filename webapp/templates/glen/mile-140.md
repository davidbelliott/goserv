# Approaching Tapestry Wall (mile 140)

![Mile 140.5. Sept. 1962.](mile-140/outlaw.jpg)

This is "the wild, red, outlaw river," as described by [Floyd Dominy](http://home.pacifier.com/~ppenn/proveglen.html) in "Lake Powell, Jewel of the Colorado."  John Mullady, Chief Ranger at Glen Canyon National Recreational Area in the mid 60's, had a view of Glen Canyon we found puzzling.  He told us, "The only reason people take float trips down Glen Canyon is to brag to their friends that they had braved the rapids of the Colorado River."  This apparently was the official National Park Service view. We got treated to a fascinating slant on how that view was disseminated: look [HERE](http://explorepdx.com/glen17.html#kearny).
