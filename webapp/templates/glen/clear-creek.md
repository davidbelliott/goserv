![Clear Creek is a wide canyon with much greenery up to its spectacular jumpup.](clear-creek/wide.jpg)

![The stream runs over a bed of bare rock and occasionally drops over a small cascade or water fall.](clear-creek/bed.jpg)

![The walls are everywere vertical. There is no way out other than downstream.](clear-creek/downstream.jpg)

![Suddenly the walls close in overhead. Your first visit here is bound to be a stunning surprise. You have never seen anything like what lies around that corner.](clear-creek/close-in.jpg)
